First things first, GNS3 will need to be installed, along with its VM. After that comes the proper docker images for the beginning of the LDAP server. 
Ideally, I'll be able to find a RedHat docker container for this, in addition to the easily-accessible Ubuntu docker image for GNS3.

If the docker containers I need don't exist, I'll instead work towards hosting the images not as containers, but as VMs in VMWare Workstation. 
They will later be dropped into GNS3 once I figure out how to do so and work compatibility angles. 

If possible, I would like for all traffic, including external, to be piped through the GNS3 network. 
This means LDAP setup and configuration may have to wait until I have a router-on-a-stick topology set up in GNS3 that pipes to the outside world, assuming it is possible.

The next step will be to get the network infrastructure set up within GNS3. 
If I find out that piping traffic to the outside world through GNS3 is not possible, this changes the future of this project drastically.
Plan A: If traffic can move to the outside in GNS3, then I intend to eventually not only make this network capable of interacting with a client on the local LAN of my home network, but I also plan on having it reach out to both AWS and GCloud and manipulate instances.
Plan B: If traffic cannot move to the outside in GNS3, then I will adopt more of a focus on a number of concepts introduced to me in both Cisco and Linux classes, as well as make the LDAP system available to a wider range of clients (ex. Windows). 
Plan B (continued): Might even look into how to make a Linux-borne LDAP server compatible with a Windows Server VM and give that VM a role that is commonly seen in the working world.

More to come as the project develops.


Spine as a possible way to speed up polling via Cacti? Could be a good rabbit hole.
